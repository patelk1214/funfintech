Robo Advisory: Fintech Revolutionizing Investing 

## Overview and Origin
Robo Advisors are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human supervision. Robo-advisors provide services, not financial planning, which is a critical component of financial success. Robo-advisor enables its customers to construct portfolio as per individual’s goal without interacting with human being. Robo-advisors don't necessarily protect against panicking and making irrational buying and selling decisions. Working with a Robo-advisor provides a low-cost solution to investors, especially for the beginners. 

## Case Study of Robo Advisor company: Interactive Avisor
Interactive Advisor was launched in 2019 by a parent company Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.'s (IBRK). IBRK is a technology driven company which provide liquidity on better terms and provides advanced trading tools to its clients. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc has been in the industry since past 42 years as a Broker Dealer. 

As per the timeline, Covestor, a Fun management company was executing trades on IBKR's platform since its launch to the public in 2007. IBRK acquired Covestor in 2019 and re-launched in 2019 as Interactive Advisors. 

Interactive Advisors is a pioneer in online investing that offers actively managed portfolios with low minimums and low fees. Interactive Advisors technology allows its clients to mimic the same portfolio managed by professional fund managers. It offers an actively managed portfolios feature with low fees, online convenience. 


## Business Activities:

Interactive Adiors offers wide range of securities to constuct porfolio based on Socially Responsible Investing & ESG strategies. It also offers entry point to various segments of customers at all levels, from beginers to more sophisticated clients. If you choose a portfolio that is not invested according to ESG strategies, you can avoid entire groups of companies that do not share your values, as well as single stock exclusions that automatically apply to all your investments.  

An Interactive Brokers feature currently in beta test, the Impact Dashboard, is available to Interactive Advisors customers via their brokerage account, and is designed to help clients evaluate and invest in companies that align with their values. 

Interactive Advisors rated very highly on Portfolio Construction. Most portfolios contain fractional shares of individual stocks and have up to 300 stocks. There are also portfolios made up of ETFs from Vanguard, Wisdom Tree, Legg Mason, State Street, and others. Other portfolios follow certain market sectors, including real estate, consumer discretionary spending, and utilities. This allows investors to take sector positions, which is something not many robo-advisories offer. You can also invest in a general global portfolio that includes equities and fixed income from across the globe. This level of portfolio customization is rare within the current robo-advisory industry and it is one of the main reasons that Interactive Advisors may be a better fit for well-informed investors who want that level of control.

The investment strategies and portfolios robo-advisors offer are based on Modern Portfolio Theory and the Efficient Market Hypothesis. They use a process to determine exactly how to invest on your behalf. 

Once again RObo Advisors is a Service not a guidance: Investment management and financial planning are both important, but they're not the same thing. Financial planning provides you with an actual human advisor who can educate and guide you to where you want to be with your money. This is an ongoing process that includes personalized attention and, importantly, accountability.
