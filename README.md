Robo Advisory: Fintech Revolutionizing Investing 

## Overview and Origin
Robo Advisors are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human supervision. Robo-advisors provide services, not financial planning, which is a critical component of financial success. Robo-advisor enables its customers to construct portfolio as per one’s goal to without interacting with human being. Robo-advisors don't necessarily protect against forgetting to contribute to investments, selling low or buying high, or panicking and making irrational decisions.
Working with a Robo-advisor provides a low-cost solution to investors.

Best for Sustainable Investing: Interactive Advisors is our top choice for sustainable investing due to its special emphasis on socially responsible investing products and the availability of pre-built portfolios invested according to ESG strategies.
Interactive Advisors offers a wide range of portfolios from which to choose. Portfolios invested according to ESG strategies, including some of the Smart Beta portfolios, are marked in the list with a green leaf.
For instance if you choose a portfolio that is not invested according to ESG strategies, you can avoid entire groups of companies that do not share your values, as well as single stock exclusions that automatically apply to all your investments. An Interactive Brokers feature currently in beta test, the Impact Dashboard, is available to Interactive Advisors customers via their brokerage account, and is designed to help clients evaluate and invest in companies that align with their values. 
Best for Portfolio Construction: Interactive Advisors is also our top choice for portfolio construction because it offers a vast range of asset classes that can be used to build a portfolio.
The portfolio choices at Interactive Advisors are varied. Most portfolios contain fractional shares of individual stocks. Some portfolios have up to 300 stocks. There are also portfolios made up of ETFs from Vanguard, Wisdom Tree, Legg Mason, State Street, and others. Other portfolios follow certain market sectors, including real estate, consumer discretionary spending, and utilities. This allows investors to take sector positions, which is something not many robo-advisories offer. You can also invest in a general global portfolio that includes equities and fixed income from across the globe. This level of portfolio customization is rare within the current robo-advisory industry and it is one of the main reasons that Interactive Advisors may be a better fit for well-informed investors who want that level of control.

The investment strategies and portfolios robo-advisors offer are based on Modern Portfolio Theory and the Efficient Market Hypothesis. They use a process to determine exactly how to invest on your behalf. You sign up and take a short survey to provide answers to a few investment-related questions. The robot plugs your answers into an algorithm that determines the kind of portfolio and asset allocation that's appropriate for your age, risk tolerance and time horizon.

It’s a Service not a guidance: Investment management and financial planning are both important, but they're not the same thing. Financial planning provides you with an actual human advisor who can educate and guide you to where you want to be with your money. This is an ongoing process that includes personalized attention and, importantly, accountability.
